% This function generates a reduced model of a GEM (GEnomescale Model).
%
% INPUTS
% - L: is an adjustable parameter indicating how far from each subsystem is
%   the algorithm allowed to search in order to find connections among
%   the subsystems. More precicely, it indicates how distant, in terms of
%   reactions, can the metabolites of any two core sybsystems be from any
%   potential interconnecting metabolite.
% - D: given that the algorithm has searched paths of up to length L, D
%   specifies how many lengths to include in the new model. if not
%   specified, this is equal to L.
% - startFromMin: default = 'yes'. if 'yes', indicates that the L's that are
%   included in the model start at the shortest distance between subsystem
%   pairs. if zero, the model is built with the first D=L levels regardless
%   of the presence of paths.
% - viewStats: options to plot statistics on the connecting pathways.
%   default is 'no'
% - OnlyConnectExclusiveMets: if this is 'yes', than only metabolites that
%   are exlusive to each subsystem will be connected. if 'no', even if a
%   metabolite is shared, it will still be connected. default = 'yes'
% - ConnectIntracellularSubsystems: if this is 'yes', than metabolites that are
%   within a subsystem will be connected to eachother. if 'no', they will
%   not be connected. default is 'no';
%   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
%   Example: L=10 D=4 startFromMin= 'yes'
%   the adjacency matrix will be calculated up to length 10, but only the
%   first 4 lengths that connect subsystems will be included. If subsystem
%   A and B have a D=1 connection, then the paths of length 1:4 will be
%   included in the model. However, the shortest distance between
%   subsystems A and C is 3 so all paths of length 3:7 will be included.
%   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% - stats: options to plot statistics on the connecting pathways. default=0
